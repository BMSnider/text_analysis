# Text Analysis

This repository contains tools to be used in quantitative analysis of text. In addition there are python 3.5(.2) implementations of algorithms as described in Algorithms: Fourth Edition by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne which I think I may find uses for in this project.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
